The value insight here is from the performance table where campaign 1  hit the highest conversion rate of 12.7% for business campaign with the support of Ad Group 1.1 which contributed the highest percentage of 16.4% higher among the rest of the Ad Group.
In addition, the highest click(33%) viewers has the lowest conversion rate (5.3%)  will need to verify the reason for the not interest, if the campaign need to be remodify to suit their need.

## A/B testing

- A/B testing in the context of email, is the process of sending one variation of your campaign to a subset of your subscribers and a different variation to another subset of subscribers, with the ultimate goal of working out which variation of the campaign garners the best results.

- A/B testing can vary in complexity, and simple A/B tests can include sending multiple subject lines to test which one generates more opens, while more advanced A/B testing could include testing completely different email templates against each other to see which one generates more click-throughs.

See visual below for the A/B testing run on two difference campaign (1 & 2) if better in any of the device presence in the dataset campaign

Campaign 1 stands as Variable A while 2 stand as Variable B
